# Budget-App

## Description:
I created a page that is a simple budget form. It takes the input and prints the results onto the browser. No tutorial needed! This was a great project for working with input, output and getting the sum as the result. It is very easy to use.

## How to Run:  
Open the page and input amounts as you see fit. 

## Roadmap of future improvements:: 
I would like to add some componeents and fix the styling.
